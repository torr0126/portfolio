Monica Torres
I created my web portfolio based on one of my purposes and passions Photography Studio, I can show the world from my perspective and create images that convey emotions, ideas, and concepts. Photography is essential as a marketing strategy for any product.

Content of the portfolio:
Home page
About page
Services page
Contact form page

I decided to use my own photo in the banner because it matches perfectly with my palette color. I keep the concept simple and clear.
It was a challenge to style the website with Bootstrap, trying to find the right classes. Now I want to continue improving and gaining more experience with Bootstrap. 

I customized the colors and Font with CSS
